## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Windows 10 or later** (Windows-only application)
- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- **Node.js and npm** (for frontend interface)
- **Admin rights** (recommended for full functionality)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**


2. **Create Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

3. **Activate Virtual Environment**
- **Windows (CMD):**
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
- **Windows (PowerShell):**
```bash
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
> If activation fails, run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`

4. **Install Python Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

6. **Run the Application**
```bash
python app_flask.py
```

7. **Set Your API Key**
- The first time you run the application, it will open in your web browser at `http://localhost:5001`.
- You will be prompted to enter your Google Gemini API key. Paste your key into the input field to activate the agent's capabilities.
- **You must set the API key before you can run any tasks.**

## üíª Usage

Once the agent is running and your API key is configured, you can start automating tasks by typing instructions into the chat interface.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance Considerations & Limitations

### Vision-Based Automation Performance
- **OCR Processing Time**: The agent uses Tesseract OCR to analyze screen content and locate UI elements. This process can take 2-5 seconds per visual action (click, type, etc.) as it captures screenshots, processes them with OCR, and analyzes the results.
- **Visual Action Overhead**: Each mouse click or keyboard interaction requires screen capture and analysis, which adds latency compared to direct shell commands.
- **Performance Optimization**: The agent prioritizes non-visual actions (shell commands, shortcuts) over visual ones when possible to minimize delays.

### Token Usage Considerations
- **Variable Token Consumption**: Token usage varies significantly based on task complexity and the amount of visual analysis required. Simple shell commands use minimal tokens, while complex visual tasks with multiple screenshots can consume hundreds of tokens per action.
- **Planning Overhead**: The agent's planning system uses tokens for each decision-making step, with complex tasks requiring more planning iterations.
- **Cost Management**: For cost-conscious users, consider using the task structure system (see below) to reduce planning overhead for repetitive tasks.

### Task Structure System - Performance Optimization
The project includes a powerful task structure system that helps mitigate performance issues:

- **Pre-Defined Workflows**: Users can create custom task structures that define specific approaches for repetitive tasks (e.g., "always use Word for reports").
- **Reduced Planning Overhead**: When a similar task is requested, the agent can follow the pre-defined structure instead of planning from scratch, significantly reducing token usage and execution time.
- **Consistent Behavior**: Ensures the agent follows user-preferred approaches rather than potentially choosing inefficient methods.
- **Adaptive Learning**: The system can adapt past successful task executions to new similar tasks, further reducing planning time.

### Recommended Usage Patterns
- **Use Task Structures**: Create task structures for frequently performed tasks to reduce planning overhead.
- **Prefer Shell Commands**: When possible, use shell commands instead of GUI automation for better performance.
- **Batch Operations**: Combine multiple related actions into single commands when feasible.
- **Monitor Token Usage**: The interface displays token usage to help you understand cost implications.

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
DEBUG_MODE=false
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH=true
ENABLE_IMAGE_GENERATION=true
```

### Custom Settings
- Modify `config.py` for advanced settings
- Adjust automation parameters in `tools/actions.py`
- Customize UI detection in `vision/vis.py`
- Configure task structures in the frontend interface

   - Check if Node.js is properly installed

2. **API Key Issues**
   - Verify Google API key in `.env`
   - Check API key permissions for web search and image generation

3. **Permission Errors**
   - Run as administrator for full system access
   - Check file/folder permissions for automation tasks

4. **Vision/Screen Capture Issues**
   - Ensure the application has screen capture permissions
   - Check display scaling settings

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode in `.env`:
```env
DEBUG_MODE=true
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```
